# Why settle for outdated market reports when you can access clear and practical insights from Next Move Strategy Consulting?

I recently went through Next Move Strategy Consulting’s [Cloud FinOps Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/cloud-finops-market-ic3314) report, and what stood out to me is that it doesn’t just stick to revenue figures like most reports I’ve seen. It actually breaks down the market in both value and volume, so you get to see numbers not only in dollars but also in physical units. That extra layer makes the data much easier to interpret and apply when making real business decisions.

Compared to some other research firms, where insights often feel a bit one-dimensional, this report gave me a clearer picture of the market dynamics. It’s not overly complicated, but it’s definitely more detailed and practical than what I’ve come across elsewhere. It’s the kind of balance that makes the information more useful, rather than just another stack of numbers.
